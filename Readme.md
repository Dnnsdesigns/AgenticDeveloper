# AgenticDeveloper

This project implements a text-based developer assistant using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. The assistant consists of a prime agent and several secondary agents specialized in different tasks such as code writing, code debugging, and code optimization.

## Project Structure

- `network.py`: Contains functions to create neural network models for text processing and the gating network.
- `agent.py`: Defines the PrimeAgent and SecondaryAgent classes.
- `train.py`: Implements the training and evaluation pipeline.
- `interface.py`: Sets up the Gradio interface for the chat window and code display.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Dnnsdesigns/AgenticDeveloper.git
    cd AgenticDeveloper
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the training script**:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```

5. **Launch the Gradio interface**:
    ```sh
    python interface.py
    ```

## Usage

The AgenticDeveloper provides an interactive Gradio interface with two main components:
1. **Chat Window**: Where you can interact with the assistant to get code suggestions, debugging help, and more.
2. **Code Display Window**: Displays the code snippets generated by the assistant.

To use the assistant, enter your request in the chat window and the assistant will respond with suggestions or code snippets based on the input.
